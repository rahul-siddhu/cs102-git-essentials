1. git status - shows all the tracked and untracked files
2. git checkout - revert back the changes which are there before the last commit statement
3. git log - shows all the commits we have written
4. git diff - compares working tree with staging area
5. git rm filename - removes the file from the hard disk
Short summary-
The cs102 course brings a variety of sub topics from linux to basics of web development.
Our course professor is Clint sir, it's a very interesting course.
Hoping more such courses in the future semester and a better interaction in the 
offline mode.
